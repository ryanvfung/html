=====================

    Versioning
    	Syntax: <major version number>.<minor version number>.<revision version number (optional)> <version status (dev)> <version type>
      Full example: 4.0.0 dev standalone
    	Latest Version:  4.0
    	Major Version: Only changed when there is a very significant differences between the new (current) and previous version - i.e.: the new version bears little similarity to the previous version number (e.g.: from 3.x to 4.0)
    	Minor Version: Only changed when there is a significant difference between the new (current) and previous version (e.g.: from 3.1 to 3.2 to 3.3)
    	Revision Version: Changed when small portions of code is debugged or tweaked for optimisation
    	Version Statuses:
    		Dev - can include malfunctional code while for development and testing - indicated by "dev" after the version
    		Use - includes code for distribution and use
    		Obsolete - version has been superseded by a newer version - indicated by smaller/lower version number
    	Version Types:
    		Normal - link to CSS and other external code - requires linking to support code and documents
    		Standalone - integrated CSS and other code - documents based on standalone versions can function on its own

    Version Usage
    	All documents formed on the Ryan Fung's (X)HTML Template should update to the latest revision version of the document - This will allow better performance for the documents
    	As there are changes in tag layouts and aesthetics between both major and minor versions, users should aim to update to the latest minor version where possible, as there will only be significant tag layouts and aesthetics differences between major versions
    	Transition versions (e.g. between 3.1 and 3.2) are not normal version releases but are development versions only - they can be used in documents but are not recommended
    	From version 4.0 onwards, all code changes must be logged</version> </version></revision></minor></major></pre>
